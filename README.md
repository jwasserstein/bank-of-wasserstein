# BANK OF WASSERSTEIN
BANK OF WASSERSTEIN is a demonstration banking application that allows users to create checking, savings, and investing accounts, submit deposits and withdrawals, and transfer money to other users. Itâ€™s a single page, fullstack application that uses React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend. The frontend is served by GitHub Pages and the backend runs on Heroku with a managed database provided by MongoDB Atlas. It was designed using Figma.
